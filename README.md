# HyperFlow - Documentation
Overview

HyperFlow is a flexible and powerful scripting language designed for automating tasks, managing files, and interacting with the system environment. It uses a declarative syntax that is easy to read and write. This documentation provides an overview of its syntax and usage, including how to create, manipulate, and manage directories and files using HyperFlow commands.

Syntax
The basic syntax of HyperFlow follows the structure of:
_<action> <function> <parameters>;_

Where:

- Action refers to the type of operation (e.g., mng for management, cxt for context).
- Function defines the specific task to perform (e.g., .cr for creating directories).
- Parameters are the arguments passed to the function (e.g., dir, nm).
